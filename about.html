        <h2>Organization FAQ</h2>
        <h3>What is the Texas A&amp;M Science Olympiad Society</h3>
        <p>The Texas A&amp;M Science Olympiad Society is an organization of former Science Olympians, of volunteers interested in STEM, and of friends at <a href="https://tamu.edu">Texas A&amp;M University</a> working together to engage future generations in scientific endeavours. A quote from our constitution that probably describes us best follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
            The members of this body shall be directly and indirectly responsible for coordinating all club and team meetings, activities, competitions etc. This body shall direct such activities in accordance with the philosophy, constitution, and by-laws of the National Science Olympiad Competition as well as those of Texas A&amp;M University. It shall act in accordance with the National Science Olympiad Mission Statement which is “to promote and improve student interest in science and to improve the quality of K-12 science education throughout the nation.” This body shall strive to foster and further STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) for all ages. In accordance with and to further this objective, the Science Olympiad Club must strive to hold general club meetings as necessary, with the Executive Board meeting monthly, or more often as necessary. The achievements of all students in association with the team and the club shall be recognized and celebrated. In addition, team test bank sessions will occur to prepare for the hosting of invitational competitions, regional competitions, state competitions, etc.
